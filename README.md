# note-taker

## Description
Hosted on Heroku, this application provides a simple way of storing and viewing notes at any time. Using Express, notes are routed and stored in a database so they are permanently there until deleted. Unfortunately, the delete function has not been created yet but will be in the near future. 

## Usage 
To run this application on your local device, simply follow this link: https://blooming-tor-94074.herokuapp.com/. When on site, click get started which will take you to the note taker page. On there, you can click the + button in the top right of your screen to start a new note and then the button next to it to save it, the save button is only visible once characters are entered into the field. Once saved, the note will appear on the left side of the app. Visual examples are provided below.
